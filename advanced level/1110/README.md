Given a tree, you are supposed to tell if it is a complete binary tree.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=20) which is the total number of nodes in the tree -- and hence the nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1. Then N lines follow, each corresponds to a node, and gives the indices of the left and right children of the node. If the child does not exist, a "-" will be put at the position. Any pair of children are separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each case, print in one line "YES" and the index of the last node if the tree is a complete binary tree, or "NO" and the index of the root if not. There must be exactly one space separating the word and the number.
